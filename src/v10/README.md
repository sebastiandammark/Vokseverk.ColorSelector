# Key/Value Editor for Umbraco

This property editor is *heavily* based on the **Multiple Textstrings** built-in
property editor, so should look and behave very similar to that one, even though
it has twice as many textboxes. (So hitting `Enter`/`Return` adds another set,
and you can sort them by using the handles on the right.)
